This is a very minimal shell. It finds an executable in the PATH, then loads it and executes it (using execv). Since it uses "." (dot) as a separator, it cannot handle file names like "minishell.h"

Begin your solution by reading the UNlX example. You will have to rewrite that code to support user interaction using the skeleton code.
